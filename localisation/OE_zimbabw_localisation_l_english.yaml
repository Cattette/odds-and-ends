 Zimbabwe_Throne_of_Stone:0 "Throne of Stone"
 Zimbabwe_Throne_of_Stone_desc_:0 "While many monarchs prefer thrones cushioned in fine silks and the like, our Godly Emperor needs no such finery. Instead he shall sit upon a throne crafted by our peerless stonemasons, and rule Zimbabwe with a fist of Stone."
 Zimbabwe_Throne_of_Gold:0 "Throne of Gold"
 Zimbabwe_Throne_of_Gold_desc:0 "The foreigners trading in and around Zimbabwe are wealthy. Not wealthy enough, however. Our Godly Emperor shall sit in a throne room composed of all the great wealth of Zimbabwe, as a statement and incentive to bring these foreigners to make our empire greater than any those merchants could dream of on their own."
 RZI_ideas:0 "Rowzi Empire Ideas"
 rzi_zimbabwe_incarnate:0 "Legacy of Zimbabwe"
 rzi_zimbabwe_incarnat_desc:0 "With the fall of Great Zimbabwe many traditions and customs have been lost. The Mutapa has built a new kind of state, independent of the age old legacy of these lands. Our people on the other hand have chosen to cling to old traditions, we still construct stone buildings that leave outsiders in awe and we still cherish that which once was."
 rzi_strict_gold_regulations:0 "Strict Gold Trade Regulations"
 rzi_strict_gold_regulations_desc:0 "Agriculture and trade bring us what we need for our day-to-day living but the main export of our country remains the abundant gold which can be found all over the Zimbabwe plateau. While such riches are a blessing to our state this metal can also be quite dangerous unless it is kept under firm control. Our state must tightly regulate all trade and ownership of Gold in order to avoid the destructive influences of fortune seekers or greedy middle men."
 rzi_empowering_the_rozwi:0 "Empowering the Rozwi"
 rzi_empowering_the_rozwi_desc:0 "A powerful faction has begun to grow in our lands, showing a strong loyalty to their leader and dissatisfaction with their lot in life in the Zimbabwe plateau. The Rozwi, or 'destroyers', are disciplined fighters ready to unify the Shona peoples and create a new type of state. If we do not embrace them we may well find ourselves overrun against our will."
 rzi_hierarchical_tax_organization:0 "Hierarchical Tax Organization"
 rzi_hierarchical_tax_organization_desc:0 "The Mutapa entrusted each subordinate chief to bring his taxes to their capital. We cannot imagine a more inefficient custom. Let us instead create a consistent system of hierarchical tax collection where each person will pass the riches on upwards towards the state coffers in an organized and efficient way. The army must also at times work as an arm of the royal bureaucracy to ensure that none of our subjects forget what we are owed."
 rzi_discipline_and_traning:0 "Regular Training"
 rzi_discipline_and_traning_desc:0 "Discipline, preparation and training are what win battles. With this in mind our commanders have successfully begun to pioneer elaborate new tactics and a new army organization. Let us make good use of these innovations by dividing our warriors into regiments and then let them train regularly with their bows, assegais, daggers and axes. Practice will also allow them to fight in formation without fear, defeating much more numerous enemies."
 rzi_mwari_cult:0 "Monotheistic Worship"
 rzi_mwari_cult_desc:0 "Our superstitious neighbors believe they are protected by natural deities or their own ancestors. We have on the other hand seen the greatness of Mwari, the one god who created the world from nothing. As he speaks the mountains tremble and our ruler is his oracle. Let us spread the cult of Mwari among all peoples so that all may see the divine authority of our ruler."
 rzi_vashambadzi:0 "Vashambadzi"
 rzi_vashambadzi_desc:0 "The growing intracontinental trade, with goods flowing back and forth from the central parts of the Kongo river basin to the trade cities of Eastern Africa, the Great Lakes and the Zimbabwe highlands has greatly enriched the Vashambadzi, our native merchant community. Let us support this group over all others by baring Swahili traders as well as European fortune seekers from trading within our borders."
